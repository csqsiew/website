I'm currently a post doctoral fellow at the University of Warwick, UK (and soon-to-be an Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore!). I graduated from the Cognitive and Brain Sciences PhD Program at the University of Kansas, USA, in 2017 and completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at the National University of Singapore in 2011. 

I'm a psycholinguist and cognitive scientist who uses techniques from network science to study cognitive structures, such as the mental lexicon and semantic memory. My research uses a combination of experimental methods from cognitive psychology, computational modeling and mathematical methods from network science, and large-scale analysis of databases and linguistic corpora to address the following questions:    

**Theme 1: How does the structure of the lexicon influence processing?**

* How does the similarity structure of the mental lexicon (the part of long-term memory that stores phonological and orthographic representations) influence spoken and visual word recognition? 
* How does the structure of the semantic language network affect semantic processing and processing of humor? 

**Theme 2: How does the structure of the lexicon change over time?**

* How does the structure of phonological and semantic language networks affect word learning and language acquisition among monolinguals, bilinguals, and second language learners? 
* How can we develop models that quantify the structure of the lexicon over the lifespan in order to help us disentangle process effects from effects due to structural change?

OK, enough of the serious stuff. When I'm not doing research, I'm either climbing, strumming my ukulele, or taking a _really_ long nap. Sometimes I work on random things like making 3-d models of networks. Here is a shameless plug for my **[Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/csqsiew)** and **[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/csqsiew)** shops.
