I'm currently a post doctoral fellow at the University of Warwick, UK. I graduated from the Cognitive and Brain Sciences PhD Program at the University of Kansas, USA, in 2017 and completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at the National University of Singapore in 2011. 

My research broadly involves using behavioral and computational methods to investigate the cognitive processes and mechanisms that support lexical processing. In particular I apply the suite of tools offered by network science to study the structure of the mental lexicon and see how that affects the way we produce speech, understand language and learn new words. I am also interested in applying network science approaches to understand other areas of the psychological and cognitive sciences. 

When I'm not doing research, I'm either out climbing, strumming my ukulele, or taking a _really_ long nap. Sometimes I work on random things like making 3-d models of networks. Here is a shameless plug for my **[Shapeways shop](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/csqsiew)**.
