I'm currently a post doctoral fellow at the University of Warwick, UK (and soon-to-be an Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore!). I graduated from the Cognitive and Brain Sciences PhD Program at the University of Kansas, USA, in 2017 and completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at the National University of Singapore in 2011. 

Iâ€™m a psycholinguist and cognitive scientist who uses network analysis to study cognitive structures, such as the mental lexicon and semantic memory. My research uses a combination of experimental methods from cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics, computational modeling and mathematical methods from network science, and large-scale analysis of databases and linguistic corpora to address the following questions:

**Theme 1: How does the structure of the lexicon influence processing?**

* How does the similarity structure of the mental lexicon (the part of long-term memory that stores phonological and orthographic representations) influence spoken and visual word recognition?
* How does the structure of the semantic network affect semantic processing?

**Theme 2: How does the structure of the lexicon change over time?**

* How does the structure of phonological and semantic language networks affect word learning and language acquisition among monolinguals, bilinguals, and second language learners?
* How can we quantify and study structural changes of the lexicon over the lifespan?

OK, enough of the serious stuff. When I'm not doing research, I'm either climbing, strumming my ukulele, or hanging out with Dougie the Corgi. Sometimes I work on random things like making 3-d models of networks. Here is a shameless plug for my **[Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/csqsiew)** and **[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/csqsiew)** shops.
